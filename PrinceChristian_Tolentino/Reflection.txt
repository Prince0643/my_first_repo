I completed the task probably about 35-40 mins. 
There aren't any problems I encountered besides the labeling. 
I was wondering because the result doesn't seem to be complete; like there's something wrong.
But then I remembered to add labels for my form.
I also added <br> tags so that it will not confuse me in my result.
Thus, I also have a background in html so this really feels nostalgic to me.
But in contrast as they say, "There's always room for improvement."
You guys taught me many helpful tips and tricks so far. I still am amazed.
